# NHS maternity analysis
 A thorough analysis of NHS maternity data. This includes an ordinary least squares regression model in order to find correlations between multiple variables (Trauma rates, deprivation birth type, mother age, smoking, complex social factors and ethnicity)
Several correlations have been found, with significant correlations between rates of emergency c sections and ethnicity as well as rates of mothers smoking compared to deprivation levels
Visualisations showing correlations can be found at the bottom of the .ipynb file. These include linear regression trend lines.
